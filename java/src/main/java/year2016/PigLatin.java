For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" (some people just add "a") is added, as in the following examples:

"pig" → "igpay"
"banana" → "ananabay"
"trash" → "ashtray"
"happy" → "appyhay"
"duck" → "uckday"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" to the end. Examples are:

"eat" → "eatway"
"omelet" → "omeletway"
"are" → "areway"

For sentences the rules apply to each word individually:

"Hello how are you?" → "Ellohay owhay areway ouyay?"

Treats 'qu' as a single phoneme, ex:

"queen" → "eenquay"
"square" → "aresquay"

bonus:
  * make sure you maintain capitalization in sentences, but with java.new letter capitalized
  * ex: "Hello, I am from Canada" -> "Ellohay, Iway amway omfray Anadacay"
